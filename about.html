        Kay is a multidisciplinary artist based in Brooklyn, NY. Their body of work explores gender, queerness, and persona as a tool for self-expression through mediums such as performance, costuming, physical computing and creative applications of technology.

They’ve shown work at Light Grey Art Lab and the Society of Illustrators, were a 2021 City Artist Corps grant recipient, and have appeared in events at venues such as The Brick, House of Yes, Club Cumming, Soho Playhouse, The Cell, Bizarre, and Chelsea Music Hall.</p><p>
